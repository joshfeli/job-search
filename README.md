# job-search
A project that grabs from a Google-search-based API to combine many query results to allow for more interdisciplinary job searches.

An extension of this project is deployed, the [Jobify](https://github.com/IsaacGil325/Jobify) web app.

Created while participating in [SEO's Tech Developer program](https://www.seo-usa.org/career/tech/).

## Program Flow
- User/Consumer inputs job fields and locations (optional) into program which then returns job results
fitting all parameters if found
- User then selects job, and is given link to job application and other pertinent details if available (such as salary)

Note: Project is dependent on a free API that limits total searches to 100 per month per account.

## Possible Future Contributions
- frontend development for project
- database usage, as search results are compiled all together into databases with every new search
